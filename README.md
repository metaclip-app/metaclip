Metaclip is a self-hosted app to store your digital archieves like images, videos, links, pages, bookmarks and more. It's an easy way to organize all the digital things we store more and more everyday and see it in a nice visual way. The project is only at the start and there's is a lot to do before letting it go public. Our goal is to only let it public on a perfect MVP.

If you want to test this new piece of digital chest we are proudly developing you can self-host our alpha.

## Getting Started
